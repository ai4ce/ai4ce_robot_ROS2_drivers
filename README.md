This repo contains all the modified ROS2 drivers for robots used in the AI4CE Lab, including Universal Robots UR10e and UFACTORY xArm6.

We made these adaptations to work with some (physical) constraints in our lab, support additional features and so on.

All packages are developed at the [AI4CE](https://ai4ce.github.io/) lab at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/).

Packages are tested on `Ubuntu 22.04` and `ROS2 Humble`. However, most of them do not rely on OS and ROS2 distro-specific features, so they should be easily portable.
